# VIB3STYLEPACK Production - Gemini Context

This `gemini.md` serves as the primary entry point for understanding the VIB3STYLEPACK Production project. It directs to concise, up-to-date context files for efficient development.

## Project Overview:
For a high-level understanding of the project's purpose, architecture, and current state, refer to:
- [`PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`](./PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md)

## Current Development Task:
For the immediate, critical development objectives and sub-tasks, refer to:
- [`CURRENT_TASK.md`](./CURRENT_TASK.md)

## Coding Standards:
For guidelines on code style, Git workflow, and testing requirements, refer to:
- [`CODING_STANDARDS.md`](./CODING_STANDARDS.md)

## Tool Usage for AI Agents:
For instructions on how AI agents (like Claude or Gemini) should leverage their tools within this project, refer to:
- [`TOOL_USAGE.md`](./TOOL_USAGE.md)

## Project Structure & Key Files:
- `index.html`: The current development target, implementing the "FIXED ARCHITECTURE - Reusable Canvas System."
- `/core/`: Contains core JavaScript modules like `VIB3HomeMaster.js` and `UnifiedReactivityBridge.js`.
- `/presets/`: Stores JSON configuration files for the editor dashboard.
- `VIB34D_ADAPTIVE_CARD_VISUALIZER.js`: Contains the WebGL shader code that needs attention.
- `archive/legacy-monolith/`: Contains older, monolithic versions of the project (e.g., `vib3code-morphing-blog.html`) for historical reference.
- `archive/legacy-fixed-architecture/`: Contains previous iterations of the "fixed architecture" (e.g., `index.html`) for historical reference.
- `archive/legacy-iterations/`: Contains other legacy iterations (e.g., `index_enhanced.html`, `index_FIXED_SYSTEMATIC_FEEDBACK.html`, `index_unified.html`, `index_JSON_CONFIGURABLE.html`) for historical reference.

## Development Philosophy:
This project is an "emergent interface system" where every visual element is mathematically connected and user interactions create ecosystem-wide reactive responses. All aspects are designed to be editor-configurable through a preset system.

**CRITICAL CONTEXT: The system operates as a "Parameter Web" where every element is interconnected and reacts systematically to changes (e.g., card hovers, element focus, parameter changes, interaction states).**

## Immediate Focus:
**The most critical task is to resolve the WebGL rendering issues in `index.html`, specifically the shader compilation errors in `VIB34D_ADAPTIVE_CARD_VISUALIZER.js`, to enable visual functionality of the 4D cube navigation.**
