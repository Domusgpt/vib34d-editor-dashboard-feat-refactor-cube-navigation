## üöÄ BOTTOM LINE

**This VIB3 system is a visual and functional success.** The core navigation works beautifully, the design is outstanding, and it provides an excellent user experience. With minor fixes to the dev controls, it would be completely production-ready.

The fact that navigation transitions work smoothly and show completely different content on each face demonstrates that the hypercube navigation concept is successfully implemented.
